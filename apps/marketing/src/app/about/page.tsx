        About {BRAND.name}
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-slate-600">
        {BRAND.name} is the agentic DPDPA compliance platform from {BRAND.company}. We're built for
        the Indian mid-market — 200 to 1,000 employees, ₹50 to 500 crore revenue — facing real
        penalty exposure (up to ₹250 crore per contravention) without a privacy team and without the
        budget for ₹25 lakh-plus enterprise compliance suites.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-10 font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500">Why "Proof"?</h2>
      <p className="mt-3 text-slate-600">
        Because the buyer's real fear isn't "are we compliant?" — it's{' '}
        <em>"what do I show the Board when they ask?"</em> The Data Protection Board can issue
        inquiries at any time. When they do, the fiduciary must <em>demonstrate</em> compliance, not
        assert it. Forty competitors are called some variant of "consent" or "comply". We own
        "proof" — the thing the regulator will actually demand.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-10 font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500">How we work</h2>
      <p className="mt-3 text-slate-600">
        Ten named AI agents — <strong>Drishti</strong> (discovery), <strong>Vibhaag</strong>{' '}
        (classification), <strong>Parikshan</strong> (assessment), <strong>Saakshi</strong>{' '}
        (evidence), <strong>Sudhaar</strong> (planning), <strong>Karya</strong> (execution),{' '}
        <strong>Lekha</strong> (audit), <strong>Nazar</strong> (regulatory watch),{' '}
        <strong>Prativedan</strong> (reporting), <strong>Sanket</strong> (market signal). Each has a
        contract, an autonomy ceiling, and tool permissions. The planning agent holds no write
        credentials — separation of duties between proposing and executing. Execution requires a
        signed, scope-bound approval token validated per action.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-slate-600">
        Every action — agent or human, read or write — is written to an append-only, hash-chained
        audit ledger. You can hand the ledger to an auditor or to the DPB and it stands on its own.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-10 font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-500">
        Where we're hosted
      </h2>
      <p className="mt-3 text-slate-600">
        All client data, evidence, and ledger entries are stored in{' '}
        <strong>{BRAND.dataResidencyRegion}</strong> on AWS. LLM inference for
        personal-data-touching tasks runs through a self-hosted model gateway on the same EKS
        cluster — no third-party model provider sees raw personal data, because no major LLM vendor
        today guarantees India-only inference.
